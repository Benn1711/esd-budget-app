## GIT WORKFLOW for Making changes

For Simplicity we all download Github desktop
1. first create a folder anywhere in your want the project to be in
2. Open github desktop click on the top left corner with current repository
3. you will see a add dropdown button click it and press "clone repository"
4. paste https://github.com/weiwen-bot/esd-budget-app into the URL textbox and choose the path where you created the folder. Then click clone
5. you should observe that you have all the files inside your local machine
6. Then click the current branch in the github desktop
7. You will then create a new branch based on the dev branch (New branch will be the name of the stuff you are working on)
8. you do not have t publish your branch


We will have one main branch would be the one that is always working
